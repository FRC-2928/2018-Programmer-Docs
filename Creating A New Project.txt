We use GradleRIO to build and deploy projecs so we can use IntelliJ as opposed to the official FRC Eclipse toolchain. To create a new project,
1. Create a new Github repository in the FRC-2928 organization, probably something like VikingRobot2019
2. Open up Git Bash, and type in
      cd Documents
      git clone https://github.com/FRC-2928/repositorynamegoeshere
3. Unzip the contents of the latest GradleRIO quickstart zip (https://github.com/Open-RIO/GradleRIO) into Documents\repositoryname
4. Ensure that you have gradle.build and gradlew.bat in the project root.
5. In Git Bash, type in
      git add .
      git commit -m "New project setup"
      git push origin master
6. If you got any errors on the commit or push steps, follow the instructions given in the output
7. Ensure that JAVA_HOME is properly set!
8. In IntelliJ, choose "Import from Version Control" and choose Github.
9. Log in with your Github credentials, and choose FRC-2928/repositorynamegoeshere
10. When it asks if you want to import the gradle project, say yes, and enable auto import on the next screen.
11. Set the team name in build.gradle to 2928, and rename every file/folder in the project that references to old team name to reflect the new change
12. Attempt a build.
13. If the build fails, it's likely because the school blocks a few domains that host GradleRIO dependencies, so consider using a wifi hotspot for the initial build
