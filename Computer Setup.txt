To set up computers for the 2018 season, we
1. Used the built in factory reset feature to go back to a fresh Windows installation
2. Fully updated with windows update
3. Installed IntelliJ Community edition
4. Installed Firefox, JDK8, JDK x64 8, Notepad++, Java 8, and 7-Zip with ninite.com
5. Installed the FRC Update Suite (Currently using http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2015/5112/en/ but google "FRC Update Suite to get the latest).
6. Installed Git for Windows (git-scm.com/download/win)
7. Set JAVA_HOME (see https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html for examples, make sure you pick the JDK in the "Program Files (x86)" folder, and you probably want jdk1.x as opposed to jdk9.x
8. Opened IntelliJ, and set the Git path to the git.exe we just installed using Settings -> Version Control -> Git
9. While in settings, set a password policy using Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Passwords -> Do not save passwords
